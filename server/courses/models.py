# #A brief Note on django model inheritance
# """
# Django supports model inheritance. It works in a similar way to standard class inheritance in Python. Django offers the following three options to use model
# inheritance:
# • Abstract models: Useful when you want to put some common information into several models. No database table is created for the abstract model.
# • Multi-table model inheritance: Applicable when each model in the hierarchy is considered a complete model by itself. A database table is created for each model.
# • Proxy models: Useful when you need to change the behavior of a model, for example, including additional methods, changing the default manager,
# or using different meta options. No database table is created for proxy models.

# Let's take a closer look at each of them.

# Abstract models
# An abstract model is a base class in which you define fields you want to include in all child models. Django doesn't create any database table for abstract models. A
# database table is created for each child model, including the fields inherited from the abstract class and the ones defined in the child model.
# To mark a model as abstract, you need to include abstract=True in its Meta class. Django will recognize that it is an abstract model and will not create a database
# table for it. To create child models, you just need to subclass the abstract model.

# The following is an example of an abstract Content model and a child Text model:
# from django.db import models
# class BaseContent(models.Model):
#     title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
#     created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

#     class Meta:
#         abstract = True

# class Text(BaseContent):
#     body = models.TextField()

# In this case, Django would create a table for the Text model only, including the
# title, created, and body fields.


# Multi-table model inheritance
# In multi-table inheritance, each model corresponds to a database table. Django creates a OneToOneField field for the relationship in the child's model to its parent.
# To use multi-table inheritance, you have to subclass an existing model. Django will create a database table for both the original model and the sub-model.
# The following example shows multi-table inheritance:

# from django.db import models

# class BaseContent(models.Model):
#     title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
#     created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

# class Text(BaseContent):
#     body = models.TextField()

# Django would include an automatically generated OneToOneField field in the Text
# model and create a database table for each model.


# Proxy models
# Proxy models are used to change the behavior of a model, for example, including additional methods or different meta options. Both models operate on the database
# table of the original model. To create a proxy model, add proxy=True to the Meta class of the model.

# The following example illustrates how to create a proxy model:

# from django.db import models
# from django.utils import timezone

# class BaseContent(models.Model):
#     title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
#     created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

# class OrderedContent(BaseContent):
#     class Meta:
#         proxy = True
#         ordering = ['created']

#     def created_delta(self):
#         return timezone.now() - self.created

# Here, we define an OrderedContent model that is a proxy model for the Content model. This model provides a default ordering for QuerySets and an additional
# created_delta() method. Both models, Content and OrderedContent, operate on the same database table, and objects are accessible via the ORM through either model.
